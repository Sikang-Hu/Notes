# Lecture 01

## How do we determine if our program is successful in paralelling/distributing the computation.

### Speedup

$$Speedup = \dfrac{Sequential \; time}{Parallel\;time}$$

Using n machines, we want to finish the same job n times faster.

### Scaleup

$$Scaleup = \dfrac{Work\;done \; Paralell}{Work\;done \; Sequential}$$

Using n machines, we want to finsh n jobs at during the same time.
