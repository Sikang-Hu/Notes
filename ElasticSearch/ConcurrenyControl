# Concurrency Control

Concurreny Control comprises the underlying mechanisms in a DBMS which handle isolation and guarantee related correctness.

## Read Phenomena

### Dirty Read

Dirty Read occurs when a transaction is allowed to read data from a row that has been modified by another running transaction and not yet committed. (a.k.a uncommitted dependency)

### Non-repeatable Reads

A non-repeatable read occurs when during the course of a transaction, a row is retrieved twice and the values are different.

### Phantom Reads

A phantom reads occurs when new rows are added or removed by another transaction to the records being read.

## Isolation Level

Most database provided a number of transaction isolation levels, which control the degree of locking that occurs when selecting data. High isolation levels should be avoid to reduce the locking overhead. Also, higher isolation level increase the possibility of deadlock. But the relaxiation should not cause software bugs.

### Serializable

> A serializable execution is defined to be an executiion of the operations of concurrently execution SQL-transactions that produces the same effect as some serial execution of those same SQL-transactions.

For lock-based DBMS, serializability requires read and write locks(acquired on selected data) to be released at the end of the transaction. Besides, range-locks must be acquired when a `SELECT` query uses a ranged `WHERE` clause.

For non-lick based concurrency control, if the system detects a write collision among several concurrent transactions, only one of them is allowed to commit.

### Repeatable Reads

For lock-based concurrency control, the write and read lock are kept until the end of the transaction, while the range-locks are not managemed.

### Read Committed

Read committed guarantees that any data read is committed at the moment it is read.

For lock-based conccurrency control, the write locks are kept until the end of the transaction, but the read locks are released as soon as the `SELECT` operation is performed.

### Read Uncommitted

The lowest isolation level, where one transaction may read not yet committed change.
